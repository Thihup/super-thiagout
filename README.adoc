= Super Thiaout

This is a port of an old game of mine called "Super Thiaout" (a clone of Breakout) that was written in C++ and SDL 1.2.

The source code of original version can be found at:
https://www.vivaolinux.com.br/script/Super-Thiagout-Breakout-O-Jogo/[Super Thiagout (Breakout)]

This project is using the Panama API to use the SDL library.

The game port is not currently finished, and probably it will be changed with the newer versions of Panama API.
